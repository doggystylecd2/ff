wip:

- ing has handled every single take over of dutch casino's (clear laundry), many of it's registered business addresses originate near headoffices (sometimes quite literally across street, as in case of first BetCity ""takeover""")
- ing has big ties with romania
- ing owns very many ip's in comparison to any other bank within netherlands (to perform BGP neighbor fraud)
- owns triodos bank, which is directly liasioned with ezugi (live casino game provider, run by David G. Wainwright (which runs fraud in it's totallity I would say most), triodos is also directly linked with GVO bank
- history of many rule violations when comes to facillitating (at the very least) illegal gambling, in most cases turning out a very high compensation fee (once it does break)
- owns Orange, and has a big part in many of the Netherland's telecom (such as manafacturing for routers for KPN as Sagem and so on)
- direct ties with scam operations like Mollie.nl, Paysoniq, Payvision.nl
- still facillitates illegal gambling through iDEAL products still being offered by the likes of playtech (india) and others but also to bigger dutch/belgium operators as Circus (jacks casino) and such
- it is unlikely that state secretary, lawyer, Fred Teeven, would've been able to subdue and go into business with "just caisno people" to be hard and basically sole lobbyist on television in favor ofa gambling
- stolen products from me personally can be found under some newer casino's
- links to lion branded operators should be frowned upon, as many use the universally 'lion' UI frontend kit directly into their products (this most likely refers to what ING calls internally "labs" and "affiliates") such as leovegas (live casino provided by David George Wainwright/Ezugi/Hollywoodtv.com for example) but also MGM and more
- responsible for edobet.com, with people like Vlad Suciu (romania), Laurence Phillipe (dutch-french) and lead by David George Wainwright (u.k.)
- has seperate hosting location next to amsterdam gateway (AMS-IX) to filter gambling games under the names of (with or without their permission, is easy to find out): MESSAGEBIRD (Mollie), TATA, ORANGE, VODAFONE.IS (libertel), AIRTEL.IN (india)
- loves high risk payments, such as facillitating Pornhub.com and others
- doesnt care about illegal gamblign areas like Turkey (imajbet etc directly bearing INGDirect's payment logo/modules)
- hunger for data, actually (somewhat) functioning businesses are being used as cover for data (banking details, profiles), per example you can take, magazin collabaration company (wpg.nl)[https://www.wpg.nl], where it provides not only for legitimate businesses services but also in example for Orange/Hollywood's Supercasino brand in South africa as "happinez" (referring to it's labor force under (happening.xyz)[happeningxyz]), Leopold (logo is dead on) referring to LeoVegas, Witte Leeuw (translates to "White Lion" and seems to refer to the white wash going on and jokingly not giving a damn, Xander referring to casino royale, royalehosting's owner 




such big dutch player like this, especially as bank, should be of a concern to dutch free society in terms of open and fair competition within telecom/internet/adult/gambling industry guarantees our data and money (like currently is) is being shipped of to foreign countries

ties to fraudulent (tax evasion, illegal gambling proceeds) accounts to u.k. should be checked upon funds and possibly company fraud by freezing assets long enough to circumvent income taxation:
